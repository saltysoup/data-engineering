# Module 4 - Athena and QuickSight

Using the Data Catalog created in the previous module (eg. spectrum), try using Amazon Athena to run SQL queries from the AWS Athena Console.

Once you have configured Athena, try creating visualization for the data using Amazon Quicksight using the [reference guide here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/create-a-data-set-athena.html)
